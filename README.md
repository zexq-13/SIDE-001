## Steps to build Model

### Loading Data 
- Load data using loader
- Use text loader for txt file
- (Optional) Load CSV by preprocessing txt file

### Splitting Data
- Splitting the Data into chunks for better sectioning
- Use Char splitting for Equal sized splits
- Use Markdown for extracting metadata and splitting based on that

### Embedding
- Converting strings to vector using embeddings
- Can use OpenAI embeddings, BERT embeddings, GloVe embeddings

### Vectorspace
- For storing the embedded data in vectorspaces for retriving later

### Retrival
- Comparing similarity scores for document retrival
- MMR for diversity in retrival
- metadata fields for additional data during retrival

### Coversation chains
- Using Langchain chat models for queries
- Using chat history for incoparating past data and forming a coversation than a single quention and done

### Evaulation
-
